- **Non-destructive editing** - Trim and adjust audio without touching the original files
- **Favorites** - Star the clips you like and filter by favorites
- **Multi-track audio** - Adjust volume for each audio track separately
- **Export** - Export and download edited clips
- **Discord sharing** - Compress clips to 10MB and drag-and-drop directly into Discord
